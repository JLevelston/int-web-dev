    <h2> To the Future </h2>
    <p>
      Growing up, I faced many challenges in life. I was born hearing impaired and found myself discouraged. Many things didn't come easy to me, but with the right people and a better look at life, I chose not to let that hinder me for what my life has in store for me in the future. I was an honor roll student througout my whole school year. I was a star athlete also. I excelled in basketball and later received an academic scholarship and was recruited to play at Indiana State University. I majored in Computer Engineering then Information Technology. At this time I was still trying to find myself and the field I see myself going into. I later took Computer Science courses and found that challenging, but the more I did it, I got a little more comfortable. Weird right? That's how I found my passion in coding. At home I practice creating web pages and studying new codes. Taking this journey is like all the challenges I faced in life and I will take it head on!
